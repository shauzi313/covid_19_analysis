# covid_19_analysis
This COVID-19 analysis reveals significant disparities in death and infection rates globally. China exhibits the lowest likelihood of death and infection, while India faces higher risks. The study calls for in-depth investigations and tailored interventions to enhance healthcare infrastructure, vaccination strategies, and pandemic management worldwide.

REPORT 
1. Likelihood of Death per Infection: 
 Identified that China has the lowest likelihood (1.1%) and India has the 
highest (4.7%) of a person dying if infected. 
 Solution: Further investigate factors contributing to these variations, 
such as healthcare infrastructure, demographics, and healthcare 
practices. 
2. Likelihood of Death per Vaccination: 
 Discovered that China has the lowest likelihood (0.002%) and Iran has 
the highest (35.165%) of a person dying if vaccinated. 
 Solution: Investigate the vaccination rollout and quality of healthcare in 
Iran to understand and address the high death likelihood. 
3. Likelihood of Infection per Vaccination: 
 Found that China has the lowest likelihood (0.055%) and Iran has the 
highest (1224.677%) of a person getting infected if vaccinated. 
 Solution: Investigate the vaccination strategy in Iran to identify reasons 
behind the high infection likelihood and implement corrective measures. 
4. Highest Death Rate Relative to Population: 
 Brazil was identified as having the highest death rate relative to 
population, while China has the lowest (0.00033%). 
 Solution: Analyze healthcare infrastructure and pandemic management 
strategies in Brazil to address the high death rate. 
5. Total Population by Continent: 
 Explored the total population for each continent. 
 Solution: Use this data to allocate resources and plan healthcare 
strategies based on continent-wise population. 
6. Average Infection Rate by Location: 
 Noted the variation in average infection rates, with the US having the 
highest (0.02%) and Australia the lowest (0.0002%). 
 Solution: Investigate factors contributing to high infection rates in the 
US and implement targeted interventions. 
7. Vaccination Percentage by Location: 
 Observed that the US and UK have vaccination percentages above 50%, 
while other countries are below 40%. 
 Solution: Assess and address barriers to vaccination in countries with 
lower percentages to achieve broader immunity. 
8. Average Vaccination Rate by Continent: 
 Revealed that the US has the highest average vaccination rate, and the 
Netherlands has the lowest. 
 Solution: Study the vaccination rollout in the Netherlands and 
implement strategies to improve vaccination rates. 
9. Locations with the Highest Infection Rates: 
 Identified the US as having the highest infection rates and Australia the 
lowest. 
 Solution: Analyze the reasons for high infection rates in the US and 
implement targeted public health measures. 
These findings provide a basis for further investigation and targeted 
interventions to address disparities and improve COVID-19 management 
strategies globally.
